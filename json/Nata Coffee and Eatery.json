It's still good though, i enjoyed it.. maybe i suggest you to pay attention with the chicken's coating, especially at the corner side is lil' bit thick so its result is too crunchy for me..\nMy fav dishes here are Chicken Parmigiana & the cheesecake. So so recommended to be repurchased ! Thx for the great service, too. We enjoyed the dinner so much.\nAnd for everyone who bring a baby, this restaurant has provided baby chair for your baby..","time":1648602902,"translated":false}],"user_ratings_total":405,"placeId":"ChIJtW3cqwvteC4Ru6i5UG1xSuc"}
